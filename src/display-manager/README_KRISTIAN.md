# Display Manager
Hi this is the template for the display manager that we're going to work on.
It's a react application that's going to run on a sub directly from the node.js
server the other team is working on. (eg. www.helloworld.com/display-manager)

However, that isn't set up yet so for now it's hosted on a localhost server.
You can start the development server by running the command
```
npm run dev
```
and opening the related ip in you're browser
(Does any of this make sense? It's like 1:23am)

Also if node is not installed on your machine you'll need to run the following commands
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
nvm install latest
cd {this directory}
npm i
```
You might need to restart the shell after the first command

## Some things of note
You are going to have to learn jsx to work on this project.
A good YouTube video on the basics is here:

The entry point of the project can be found at "./src/App.jsx"
In fact, all the files you need to worry about are at "./src/*"

Depending on how early I go to sleep, I may or may not write up 
specification on the display-manager so that we have a very clear
understanding of what needs to be done. 

Also sorry about your files you put in here. I've moved them out 
but of this directory so you can still use them for learning 

Alright time for sleep ;)
