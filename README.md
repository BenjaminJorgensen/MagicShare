# MagicShare - Team HelloWorld
For project 041, Proxiemic Displays.

![Display-Use](./documentation/readme-files/display-splash.png)

## Motivation

The product MagicShare is designed to be a platform for users to seamlessly and spontaneously share images with each other via a large interactive display. These iterations are described to be proxiemic because they are effected by the users physical lactation in relation to the large display. In other words, users are permitted to connect to the display and share images from their device if they are close to the display. The user's images will remove themselves from the display if they walk too far away from the screen. Sending images to the screen is designed to be as frictionless as possible, requiring no authentication obstacles.

## When would I use MagicShare?

MagicShare is perfect for large groups of people where showing content on a small device would be impractical.
With traditional content hosting services, there is one "presenter" who controls all of the content being displayed.With MagicShare, the system is decentralised, allowing all users the opportunity to excess themselves.


## How do I use MagicShare

![Splash Screen](./documentation/readme-files/display-use.png)

1. Ensure you are connected to the correct network. MagicShare can be set up on any network owned by the installer but by default the network is called ``HELLOWORLD``

2. Scan the barcode displayed on the screen. You will be directed to our web application.

3. Upload images using the web application. You can select any from your devices file explorer. When you want to remove your images, simply walk away, disconnect form the network or click, "Remove my Images".


## Client-Side
Features:
* Users can upload images to the server from their file explorer.
* Users can disconnect from the server, and after that, no more images will be uploaded.
